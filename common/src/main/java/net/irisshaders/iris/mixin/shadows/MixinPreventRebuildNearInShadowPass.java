/**
 * Prevent nearby chunks from being rebuilt on the main thread in the shadow pass. Aside from causing FPS to tank,
 * this also causes weird chunk corruption! It's critical to make sure that it's disabled as a result.
 * <p>
 * This patch is not relevant with Sodium installed since Sodium has a completely different build path for terrain
 * setup.
 * <p>
 * Uses a priority of 1010 to apply after Sodium's overwrite, to allow for the Group behavior to activate. Otherwise,
 * if we apply with the same priority, then we'll just get a Mixin error due to the injects conflicting with the
 * {@code @Overwrite}. Using {@code @Group} allows us to avoid a fragile Mixin plugin.
